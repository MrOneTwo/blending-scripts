This is a place where I keep my Blender scripts. Some of them might be useless for you. Some might be educational. Some might become something more...

- `lashes.py` - script for generating eyelashes. Actually pretty useful already. Needs documentation for sure.
- `rpc_client.py` and `rpc_server.py` - examples of calling functions in Blender from a remote client. Read more here: http://ciesie.com/post/blender_python_rpc/
- `utils.py` - specific script. Read more here: http://ciesie.com/post/blender_flexible_python/
